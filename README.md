- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Alstenvaz
- As an aspiring Software Developer with an innate interest in computer systems, I made the decision to pursue a Master of Computer Science from Pace University in Fall 2022 to further my programming expertise.  I recently completed my undergraduate career with a Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology from Mumbai University, during which time I had the opportunity to build and program robotic technologies including drones, design interactive video games, and enhance my knowledge of programming languages, web technologies, and operating systems.
-  My passion for technology led me to launch Trade Protein Market (TPM), an e-business designed to promote health supplements marketed by fitness professionals.  Through developing and maintaining the website, I have supported my clients with increased revenue and traffic.  

- Creativity is my strongest skill, and as such, I am looking for an opportunity to collaborate with industry professionals to translate business requirements into engaging, unique web solutions.  Interested in learning more about me?
